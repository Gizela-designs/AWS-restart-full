# NETWORKING
Under networking we had a few labs, i will show 2 labs i found challenging

# Internet Protocols - Public and Private IP addresses
 
## Objectives
In this lab, you will:

- Summarize and investigate the customer scenario
- Analyze the difference between a private and public IP address
- Develop a solution to the customer's issue in this lab


## Task 1: Investigate the customer's needs
- Type and search for VPC

- Launch VPC Wizard

- Configure the following options:

- For IPv6 CIDR block, leave No IPv6 CIDR Block selected. You will not be using IPv6 in this lab.

- For the VPC name, enter First VPC

- For Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR, this option prefills. Input the correct VPC CIDR that you are using; however, keep in mind that the public subnet's CIDR must be smaller then - the VPC CIDR block, and it must be able to include at least 50 IP addresses.

- For Availability Zone, choose No Preference.
