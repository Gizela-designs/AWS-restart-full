## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Kutloano Kekana. My journey into tech didn’t start with a traditional career path or years of industry experience. I’m stepping into this world fresh, curious, and determined to build something meaningful. Right after high school, I chose to pursue a degree in robotics, a field that sparked my imagination and encouraged me to think differently about technology. Although that path is currently on pause, it led me toward something deeper. It opened up a passion for understanding how modern systems are created, how they communicate, and how technology can solve real problems.

I don’t have much formal workplace experience yet. Most of my early responsibilities came from tutoring kids in my community and staging cellphones. These roles may seem small, but they strengthened the foundation I rely on today. They taught me responsibility, patience, and how to explain ideas clearly. Those skills became the backbone of how I learn, adapt, and approach challenges.

## 💻 Technical Journey

As my interest in technology grew, I began building my skills step by step. I completed the FNB Full Stack Developer certificate, where I learned the basics of HTML, JavaScript, Python, and what it means to bring ideas to life through code. I also earned my TEFL certificate, which sharpened my communication skills and helped me understand how to break down complex information in a simple and effective way.

More recently, I completed the 12-week AWS re/Start program, an intensive cloud training experience that pushed me far outside my comfort zone. Working hands-on with EC2, S3, IAM, VPCs, Auto Scaling, and other AWS services gave me a strong foundation in cloud computing. This journey has now led me to pursue the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification as my next milestone.

## 🎓 Education and Growth

Every course, lab, and new challenge has shown me how much I enjoy learning. I’m fascinated by the way systems connect, how networks communicate, and how cloud infrastructure supports almost everything we use today. My journey hasn’t been linear, but it has been intentional. I’m consistent, open-minded, and committed to improving a little more every day.

## 🎯 Career Goals

Right now, I’m searching for my first opportunity in the tech industry. I’m especially interested in roles like Cloud Support Associate or Junior Cloud Engineer, where I can apply what I’ve learned while continuing to grow my skills.

In the long term, I see myself becoming an AWS Solutions Architect, working with organizations to design secure, efficient, and scalable cloud architectures. The idea of improving systems, solving technical challenges, and helping businesses transition into the cloud is something that truly motivates me.

## 💪 What I Bring

I may be new to the tech industry, but I’m committed, curious, and ready to learn. What I lack in experience, I make up for with determination, patience, and a strong willingness to grow. I pay close attention to detail, communicate clearly, and approach every challenge with an open mind. My path may be unconventional, but it has shaped me into someone who shows up, learns quickly, and keeps pushing forward.
