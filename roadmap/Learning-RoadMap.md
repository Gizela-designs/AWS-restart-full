## 🚀 AWS re/Start Program – My Cloud Journey

The AWS re/Start program was a 12 week turning point for me, not just a course. It was the place where cloud computing stopped being something abstract and instead became something I could actually work with, understand, and build. The goal was to prepare for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, but in reality, it became the foundation of how I think about technology today.

## My Progress Timeline

The program unfolded in three phases.
The first month was all about building a strong foundation. The second month moved deeper into AWS services and their purpose. By the final month, everything came together in a way that made the cloud feel less intimidating and far more exciting.

During Weeks 1 to 4, I learned the basics that everything else depends on.
Weeks 5 to 8 were where things finally clicked and AWS started to feel familiar.
Weeks 9 to 12 shifted into more advanced topics and certification preparation.

## ☁️ Month 1: Foundation
## Week 1: Cloud Foundations

This was my introduction to the cloud itself. I learned what cloud computing really means, why AWS is so widely used, and how global infrastructure is designed. Navigating the console felt confusing at first, but day by day it became familiar territory.

## Week 2: Linux Fundamentals

Most of the week was spent inside the command line, learning how to move through directories, manage files, set permissions, and work with basic scripting. It felt like learning the language of machines for the first time.

## Week 3: Networking Foundations

Networking answered questions I didn’t even know I had. I learned how devices communicate, how IP addresses and subnets work, and why DNS exists. Linux networking commands helped me see everything in action.

## Week 4: Security Essentials

Security was eye opening. I learned how firewalls, encryption, access rules, and identity management protect cloud systems. The idea of least privilege became a principle I now apply everywhere.

## 🔍 Month 2: AWS Deep Dive
## Week 5: Python Basics

This week connected coding with problem solving. I worked through my first Python programs, practiced variables, loops, functions, and data structures. Everything tied back to automation.

## Week 6: Databases

I learned the difference between SQL and NoSQL, how relational databases operate, and how Python can connect to them. It gave context to why services like RDS and DynamoDB exist.

## Week 7: AWS Architecture

This was where the cloud started making sense as a whole. I explored RDS, DynamoDB, the Well Architected Framework, scalability, elasticity, and cost optimization. It was the closest I’d come to thinking like a cloud architect.

## Week 8: Automation

I worked deeply with EC2, learned infrastructure as code using CloudFormation, used the AWS CLI, and explored monitoring and logging. Automation became one of the most exciting parts of the program.

## 🧭 Month 3: Advanced and Career Development
## Week 9: Serverless and Containers

I explored Lambda, Auto Scaling, Docker, ECS, and Route 53. This week felt like stepping into the real world of modern applications.

## Week 10: Monitoring and Security

CloudWatch, alarms, IAM deep dives, cost management, and even the basics of CI CD pipelines made the cloud feel complete and manageable.

## Week 11: AI and Machine Learning

Machine learning concepts were introduced using AWS services like SageMaker, Rekognition, Comprehend, Polly, and even Amazon Bedrock. It opened my eyes to how accessible AI actually is.

## Week 12: Certification Preparation

The final week ties everything together. I reviewed services, explored exam strategies, completed practice questions, and worked on building my portfolio and polishing my resume. My target is to earn the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

## 🎓 Certification Objective

I am preparing to sit for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.
The program recommends achieving a score of at least 700 out of 1000.
I’m currently building and strengthening my foundation to reach that milestone.

## ☁️ Skills I'm Building

Throughout the program I’ve strengthened my understanding of AWS cloud architecture, Linux administration, Python automation, networking and security fundamentals, SQL and NoSQL databases, and even foundational AI ML concepts. I’ve also developed a deeper interest in DevOps and Infrastructure as Code.

## 🌟 My Success Strategy

I’ve learned that consistency is the key to mastering anything in tech. Even if I only have thirty minutes, I use it to learn, practice, or build something small. I try to stay hands on by creating real projects, connecting with other learners, embracing mistakes as part of the process, and celebrating the progress I make along the way.
